# c26-lsdj-samplekits
My very own LSDJ kits that I make available to the public. No credit needed, but link-backs are appreciated.
These kits might require LSDJ version 9.4.0 or higher. I haven't tested these on older versions and probably will not ever unless necessary.

Here's the LSDJ patcher ting:

Also the how-to on the LSDJ Wiki and whatnot:
